### 00-playground
In this module, I delved into the fundamentals of Swift, learning about syntax, control flow, and 
semantics. This section serves as the bedrock of my understanding of Swift programming.

### 01-i-am-rich
Here, I explored UIKit Storyboarding, mastering the use of IBOutlet, Constraints, Alignments, and 
getting comfortable with XCode. This project was my first foray into creating a visually appealing iOS 
app.

### 02-dice
This project focused on enhancing my understanding of Control flow and integrating the ViewController 
with the Storyboard. I learned the intricacies of linking UI components to Swift code.

### 03-magic-8-ball
The Magic 8 Ball app allowed me to experiment with UIImage, ViewController, and IBAction. It was a fun 
project that combined UI elements with user interactions.

### 04-auto-layout
This module was dedicated to mastering UIKit auto layout. I learned how to use constraints and 
Storyboard StackedViews to create responsive and aesthetically pleasing layouts.

### 05-xylophone
In the Xylophone app, I applied advanced auto layout techniques and explored the AVFoundation framework 
to play sound. This project was instrumental in enhancing my skills in audio integration and complex UI 
layouts.

### 06-egg-timer
The Egg Timer app helped me understand GestureRecognizer and the use of Timer in Swift. I also delved 
into Swift's powerful Array and Dictionary structures, applying them in a practical project.
